        <p class="mainparagraphs">I have a keen interest in mental health and have been helping individuals with schizophrenia live meaningful lives. Through my work, I have honed my soft skills, such as communication and empathy, which have been invaluable in building relationships with clients. Aside from my work, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies, which include playing video games, traveling, and keeping up to date with whats new in tech. I find that these activities help me recharge and stay motivated to pursue my goals.</p>
        <p class="mainparagraphs">I'm currently learning web development with Coder Academy and am excited to explore this new direction in my career. I believe that the skills and knowledge I gain from this program will enable me to create meaningful solutions that positively impact people's lives.</p>
